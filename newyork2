We are on a train going over the manhattan bridge
(New York is a city all about trains)
And sharing the sunset over that stone giant
The arc of which is so divine
When I am sleeping I look like the Brooklyn Bridge

Everybody
Everybody on that train falls in love
Or is reminded of why they fell in love with the city
As hard as it is
How lucky we are
