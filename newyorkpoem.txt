I miss New York so much.

I miss climbing the steps alone in fort tryon park
high as a kite on a clear blue day
looking east over the Bronx
imagining I was a warrior
and New York was my city to defend

I miss the light at dawn
on the cornices of morningside heights
buying a hot bagel at six in the morning
after not sleeping the whole night
studying

I miss sitting in your windowsill
that hot summer night in your first apartment
by a church in lefferts gardens, remember?
feeling like we were at the center of the world
just being in New York
