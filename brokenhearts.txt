It's hard to draw a broken heart
so I start with simple shapes
in my notebook at the bar
alone in social space

I like to put tattoos on me
they feel like little gifts
a secret shared from me to I
I never move my lips

It's hard to draw a broken heart
I know how it should look 
but knowing's cheap and doing's hard
put that one in your book
