i'm starting a news network
that only interviews celebrities
and a magazine run by its interns

i'm inaugurating a new subterranean politics:
a revised marxism for lepers and children

in my new economics
stupidity is not permitted
as a synonym for humanity

like: low information voters
or: the uninformed consumer

i'm taking a job in hell

and starting a religion
based on spiritual travel
between secret worlds
