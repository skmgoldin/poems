We will take the humans off Hawaii
We will make nature a paradise
The military and parks service budgets will be
switcharooed

The taps will run black with coffee
And everyoneâ€™s gonna go veg

The velvet underground will play my inaug
we'll do free tattoos
And dance 85 ragas to a disco inferno

We will decide on a pronunciation of "gyro"
In consultation with the Greeks
And when it is done I will do a press conference
And say the word on television several times

You'll do coke in the White House
I'll never drink again
I'll work hard like Barack Obama
So you don't have to

There will be sleepovers with Justin Trudeau 
And why do war when we have video games?

We will cry every day
And those guilty of love will be pardoned
The age of consent will be raised to 25
