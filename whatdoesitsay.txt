Why do you love the people you do?
It's impossible to say.

All I've come up with is: love is like pornography
and also: it hits you over the head with a frying pan

All my girlfriends have been older and wiser
Both spoke french
they were brunettes
and taller than me
both of them agreed: my french is terrible

What does that say about me?

Do I have a type?

When someone asks me what's my type
I never say:
french-speaking
brunette
taller than me

I say: kind.

but clearly

I'm lying
