We are on a train going over the manhattan bridge
(New York is a city all about trains)
And watching the sunset over that stone giant
Whose back is arced just so
Is it sleeping?

Everybody
Everybody on that train falls in love
Or is reminded of why they fell in love with the city
As hard as it is
How lucky we are
